# time_to_67

time_to_67 is a Bash script that calculates the remaining years, months, and days until you reach the age of 67 based on your birthday.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the `time_to_67.sh` script from this repository.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is located.
3. Run the following command to make the script executable:

   ```
   chmod +x time_to_67.sh
   ```

4. Execute the script by running the following command:

   ```
   ./time_to_67.sh
   ```

5. Enter your birthday when prompted in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`.

The script will then calculate and display the remaining years, months, and days until you reach the age of 67.

## Example

Here's an example of how the script works:

```
Enter your birthday (YYYY-MM-DD): 1990-05-15
You have 42 years, 0 months, and 19 days remaining until you reach the age of 67.
```

If the current date is already beyond your 67th birthday, the script will display the following message:

```
Enter your birthday (YYYY-MM-DD): 1950-01-01
You have already reached the age of 67.
```
